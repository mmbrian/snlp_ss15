The Siberian crane stands four and a half feet tall, its brilliant white plumage offset by a blood-red beak, face and legs. Jet-black wing quills are visible in flight. Like most birdwatchers, I have only seen them in pictures -invariably in supremely elegant poses, their long, thin beaks delicately probing the water for weeds. Unlike most birdwatchers, I am lucky enough to live less than four hours' drive from their regular winter home a wildfowl marsh constructed by one of the Maharajahs of Bharatpur. I was there recently, talking to Dr Lalitha Vijayam about her research on the Siberian crane's problems and about my chances of seeing one before the Ob river race becomes extinct.

No official go-ahead from the national safety authorities has yet been given. But French nuclear experts are convinced that the reference accident (a core melt-down in which the molten fuel reacts with the sodium coolant) is so improbable that the secondary containment dome can be done away with. In light-water reactors (including PWRs) the concrete shell of the reactor building needs to withstand a pressure of five bars, whereas a fast breeder has to cope with a mere 40 millibars, according to an Electricite de France engineer. One advantage of a rectangular reactor building will be a much simpler overhead crane . The revolving crane in Super-Phenix is still not working properly.

And Richard Parks, an engineer with the Bechtel Corporation, which built the plant and is the prime contractor for the clean-up, claimed that the operation is disorganised and at times irresponsible. There is a serious lack of coordination between Bechtel, GPU, the subcontractor and the federal agencies involved here. Bechtel has since suspended Parks. One point of contention is GPU's plan to use a crane inside the reactor building to lift the 170 tonne steel top off the reactor and then lift out the 40 000 uranium fuel elements in the stricken reactor. Parks and Gischel say that the crane may have been damaged in the original accident. GPU and Bechtel counter that tests have shown no sign of damage to the crane, and that all procedures were safe.

It is for this reason whales and hippopotami actually increase their mass to prevent floating. There is also evidence, as we have mentioned before and shall see in the next chapter, of the extensive use of air sacs in sauropods as cooling devices and for reducing mass. Many sauropods, in spite of their ever-growing height spurred on by the need to reach the foliage of trees growing ever higher, had hollowed out, weight-saving vertebrae and a pelvic girdle described by one writer as being like a suspension bridge, with the massive erect hind legs acting as the down-pillar, and the long torso and rigid tail acting as the cross-span. Indeed, the six-metre long sauropod neck has been likened to a living crane for lifting the head to feed, with up to fifteen vertebrae possessing unique extra articulations in the neck to combine strength with agility.

When the North American Indians gave fresh cranberries as a gift to the Pilgrim families, it's unlikely that they were aware of the berries' peculiar talent they can bounce! Today, it is this factor which determines whether they will be sold as fresh fruit or processed into juice or sauce. During the selection process berries are bounced along shaking conveyor belts which are crossed with four inch high wooden barriers they must be fresh and firm enough to bounce over the boards. A dollop of cranberry sauce has been the traditional accompaniment to turkey since the Pilgrim Fathers ate what they called crane berries (the flowers resemble cranes) probably in the form of a sauce with turkey at the Thanksgiving feast, celebrating their survival of the first winter spent in America.

Both The Daleks and The Sensorites featured very elaborate backdrops, all of which Cusick had first to draft out as large, highly detailed colour illustrations long before the day when the Scenic Artist would come in to paint them up. Neither could these illustrations just be rough approximations of the finished articles. The perspectives, the horizon points, the viewing angles all had to be worked out beforehand so that camera shots would enable the backdrops to appear as natural continuations of the sets, instead of suddenly sloping up or downhill. If a crane camera was to be used, for instance, it would be no use designing a backdrop with a vanishing point relevant to one of its pedestal mounted brethren.

One advantage is that if for any reason the storage system becomes unused the building may be used for other purposes. The racking is constructed on a back-to-back principle up to 20 metres high with intervening gangways as little as 1.5 metres wide. Typical rack lengths are between 100 and 200 metres and number of aisles can vary from as little as 2 to as many as 30. In some systems one crane serves more than one aisle and in this case is moved from aisle to aisle by an automatic transfer system. Pallets may be placed away either under manual or automatic control according to the control system chosen. In the case of manual systems one person per crane is usually all that is required to operate that part of the system with in-feed fork- lift trucks being restricted to an access area at the front of the warehouse. Automatic systems usually have an in-feed/out-feed conveyor and sufficient forklift trucks to feed the system again in each case they are not operating within the crane and storage area. A firm principle with this kind of automatic system is restriction of access to anyone other than maintenance and inventory control personnel, in which case a strict control is kept upon crane operation.

Overall these species are darker, smaller and hairier than temperate counterparts. Darkness and hairiness, especially noticeable in butterflies of the genera Boloria and Colias , are taken to be adaptations for absorbing and retaining heat during basking. Smallness facilitates rapid warming to working temperatures, though it may also be a symptom of food sparsity; compactness, including relative shortness of limbs and wings, helps to conserve heat and moisture. Wings are short or absent in several arctic species of stone flies, crane flies, midges and moths; females are especially likely to have reduced wings and to avoid flying.

As a result, the whole area became silent, with all big and small trees dead, many of them burned by napalm and excavated by bombs. No forest trees could regrow naturally in these areas. Once the forest cover disappeared, the rain washed the topsoil away, and the land was covered with useless savannah, which we Vietnamese called American grass. As the habitat was reduced, many species of animals that were common before the war now became rare, and many, such as rhinos, tigers, gibbons, douc langurs, pheasants and the eastern sarus crane now face extinction.

Because China is a vast country with many dialects, certain kung fu schools practise styles that are the same but have different names. The praying mantis style for instance, is known in Cantonese as tong long or won long. The kung fu styles developed at the Shaolin temple were based on the movements of animals. There were five in all, the tiger, crane , leopard, snake and dragon. In later years one or two animals were adopted, along with their natural movements, to form the nucleus for a complete system of kung fu. The southern Chinese style of hung gar (Hung family) was adapted from the Shaolin tiger system, which also incorporates movements from the white crane style.

The Liebherr LTM 1090 crane replaces a similar capacity vehicle which had been in service at the terminal since May 1982. The all-terrain model offers steering on all its ten wheels, a facility which enables it to be crabbed into position in tight situations. The crane combines its 90-tonne lifting capacity with a fully-extended reach of 67 metres. An onboard computer in the driver's cab provides instant on-screen information about various lift/load configurations. A cut-off device is automatically activated in the event of an overload. Services engineer Jim Hunter, who is responsible for vehicle and plant maintenance on the terminal, told BPXpress: The remote location of Sullom Voe means that having a reliable crane is essential.

The symbolic usage of here, as in (70), can be glossed as the Pragmatically given unit of space that includes the location of the speaker at CT. (7) I'm writing to say I'm having a marvellous time here The gestural usage must be glossed a little differently, as the pragmatically given space, proximal to speaker's location at CT, that includes the point or location gesturally indicated. Note that we cannot eradicate the modifier pragmatically given in these definitions: an utterance of (71) may have quite different implications of precision if said to a crane operator in contrast to a fellow surgeon.

The disease has infected animals in at least ten US zoos and can spread through rodents. Diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS are known as emerging viruses, which, although they do not always threaten their original hosts, can destroy entire populations by moving on to new hosts and locations. Human interference has often been responsible for such introductions. In the case of the rare hooded crane , the introduction of a foreign herpes virus has threatened the remaining wild population.

When my chap turned to confront the Manston sentry who was on guard with a rifle and one round, and obviously felt that the chap on the wrong side of the wire could be one of those attacking his airfield my chap said sharply something to the effect: Can you get us out of here? and explained that he only meant his oppoes, not the Stirling. The sentry is claimed to have replied: Now don't abaht, I've got one up the spaht but rushed away to get the orderly corporal who, in turn, found the situation beyond his authority, and we were only released by no less than the duty officer.

Lists Terms often contain lists: for instance, of rights which may be exercised in certain situations, or of facilities to be provided. They may provide considerable scope for disputes over meaning. For instance, if the terms provide that The Supplier shall bear the cost of connecting the goods to the electricity, gas, water and other services who is reponsible for connecting the goods to the telephone network, or to the buyer's internal computer network? Similarly, if the contract provides that The Customer shall provide such temporary roadways, footways, scaffolding and other equipment as may be necessary for the safe installation of the goods who has to bear the cost of equipment hire if a fork lift truck, or heavy lifting crane , is needed for the installation?

He had obtained the auctioneer's catalogue only a day before the sale and the purported effect of the clause was to relieve the sellers from telling more than a part of the material facts, thereby obliging the buyer to check the remainder for himself. There are suggestions in the judgment that the decision would have been otherwise had the buyer been a property speculator. This allows a court to adjust its decision according to the other party involved. Such a phenomenon may be illustrated further by the facts in Phillips Products v Hamstead Plant Hire (1985) 4 TrL 98, which involved the hire of a crane and driver.

Weldex paid Price Waterhouse, the receiver, nearly 1 million for the business, which had a turnover of 5 million last year. Doug McGilvray, Weldex's managing director, said that at a stroke, the move had removed its biggest competitor in Scotland and doubled its own crane-hire fleet. In terms of general plant, Piper was bigger than us, while we were larger than them as crane operators, he said.

ANOTHER example of the investment in Courtaulds Chemicals' Buckhaven site in Scotland is pictured being hoisted into position. The vessel, affectionately known as a scrubber, is a reactor that ensures no gas by-products from chemical processes are vented to the atmosphere. The large capacity of the reactor means gases can be scrubbed more quickly, removing a bottleneck and allowing the production process to operate more quickly. Installation involved hoisting the reactor by crane and gently lowering it into a prefabricated steel structure.
