One concentrates solely on hand lines (chiromancy) while others are only interested in the form of the hand (chirognomy).

The team at Osmania University investigated the possibility that fingertip and palmar patterns may somehow act as genetic markers of susceptibility to duodenal ulcers. They compared the finger and palm prints of 64 healthy adult males and 90 males with duodenal ulcers. They examined fingerprints for arches, loops and whorls, and palmprints for the presence or absence of patterns in the thenar, hypothenar and interdigital areas. Whorls were most frequent amongst men suffering from duodenal ulcers (44 per cent compared with 37 per cent in healthy subjects) and loops Here less frequent (51 per cent compared to 58 per cent). In addition, patterns were most frequent amongst duodenal sufferers in the thenar I (21 per cent compared with 3 per cent) and interdigital IV (54 per cent compared with 45 per cent) areas of the palm.

He caught hold of her hand and pushed it between his legs and ground his mouth against hers. The dullness she had felt in her exhaustion became a kind of sickness now, as for the second time that day she once again flew from her own body and split into two. Two Ariels, one outside the other, each watching the other, curious, inert, from the other side of consciousness, in the country where the souls wander. She was curious, about the whey in his mouth and the shaft of his cock under her palm and the paired kernels of his balls; about the possibility of pleasure her mother Sycorax who was dying now beside her had talked of so often.

Our capacity to deny or block out the pain can wear thin. Sometimes our bodies and minds seek excuses to experience griefs that we may have put aside or denied because we couldn't face them at the time.

His hands were careful and restrained, his mouth tender, and although only a very short while later, Cassie was to realize just how much self-control he had exerted at that moment of their first real physical contact, for those few minutes, she knew only that she was not afraid of him, nor even suspected that there was any need to be. As his passion grew, to be answered in kind by her own almost overwhelming desire, his arms tightened their hold and his mouth sought hers with greater urgency. There was a forceful thrusting kind of need about his actions now, and he began to fumble rather clumsily, with the buttons on the front of her light, cotton dress. The thin material parted under his fingers and he pushed his hand beneath it to find his palm brushing her naked breast.

Packers anxious reassurance that they are all portraits (relieving us of the potentially dangerous task of distinguishing those that are not) requires him to identify and locate a sitter or sitters. The evident difficulty of writing about an artist who has transformed the traditional process of mapping a terrain of physiognomical likeness onto the production of a surface that suggests a process of physical disintegration rendered in assertively material terms is resolved by Packer in an oblique but entirely conventional manner. The artist as subject is involved as authority for the authenticity of the subject as sitter and hence also for the legitimacy of the object as portrait. The artist's intimacy with a handful (the possessive act of holding in one's palm ) of familiar sitters, fixed and therefore by implication immoveable both in the sense that they pose like good models and in the sense that they do not leave, travel or change and therefore have no narratives of their own.

I suggest that one solution for biologists will be to apply their expertise to the new science of socioecology, and the environment of the office. There will be plenty of money available from rich companies, just as soon as socioecology becomes as well-established as graphology and palm -reading.

The perfect world they sought lay in the individual and not in any dream of an idyllic country life. In the first stanza of The Garden Marvell rejects the outer world of human activities for inner world of peace and retirement in a sanctified garden. Here he can escape from the imperfect society to be an individual alone, attended by nature. He immediately cuts himself off from those ambitious city men who try to win the palm , the oak, or bays, emblematic of the rewards given for artistic, political and military achievement.

The afternoon was very energetic since we travelled up to Doncaster Dome where we went ice skating. The rink was on two levels and had an Alpine atmosphere to it with pine trees and the snowflake effects. We spent about two hours doing this before going swimming. The contrast of a tropical atmosphere with palm trees and shrubs had been created.

There was no sign of movement from the tent, and the flap was closed, possibly tied from inside. They edged down the bank, slithering on the grass. He's taken them.

Sometimes the slaps were delivered with a smile, sometimes after a scream, sometimes in silence, sometimes in the middle of the screaming. If she answered back, woe betide her. If she kept mum, God help her. An open palm , a fist, a stick, a belt, a saucepan: whatever came to hand.

I need your discretion, yes, but I will not have you brought into needless suspicion or danger upon this account. Here, wear this!

It was a short letter. He explained the circumstances, that his close friend had cancer and was very ill and needing Babur's support.

He swung her up into his arms and carried her over the threshold into the shadowy interior and beyond to the shuttered darkness of the bedroom. The bed received her softly. He did not join her immediately as she'd half expected, but sat down beside her.

The unexpected admission made her heart leap, causing her to turn and look at him with eyes that were bright with hope. But he remained silent, and, despondently, she turned away again, realising that there would be no words of love coming from this man, who now held her heart in the palm of his hand.

Magee and O'Brien were arrested in nearby Pontefract four days later. In his final speech, Mr Nutting told the jury O'Brien had admitted being at the scene of both shootings, but the Crown had to prove he was a participant. Pc Kelly's identification of him; a footprint at the murder scene matched a trainer Magee threw away in Pontefract, and clothing he dumped matched the description of what the gunman was wearing. Another key piece of evidence was Magee's palm print on the roof of the police car, matching Pc Kelly's description of how he steadied himself before firing.

The driver sat drumming his fingers nervously on the steering wheel while the attendant busied himself filling the tank, checking the oil and radiator, and wiping the windscreen. All the time, the silence in the car was broken by the harsh, rattling breathing of the occupant in the back seat. When he'd finished, the attendant stuck the chamois leather in his belt with a flourish and leaned down again to the driver's window. That'll be fifteen-forty, he announced, presenting his palm for the money.

For research purposes, these are special burrows with removable lids and it was from one of these that a research student from Oxford University picked out an adult and a chick like rabbits from a hat. Much oohing and aahing from children and adults alike, as the chick looked just like a big cuddly toy and it didn't have nearly such a sharp beak, as Jane was about to find out. You can concentrate on two things for only so long as changing positions to help the photographer and holding the adult shearwater proved. For a fraction of a second Jane was off guard and the shearwater struck right in the palm of her hand.

Unemployment, however, was expected to fall from 8.1 per cent in 1988 to 7.9 per cent in 1989 due mainly to increased job opportunities in the manufacturing sector, whose contribution to GDP was estimated to have expanded from 24.4 per cent in 1988 to 25.6 per cent in 1989. Manufacturing output increased by 15.5 per cent in 1988, while manufacturing growth was estimated at 13 per cent for 1989. Agriculture continued to provide a large share of GDP: its contribution in 1989 was estimated to be 20.2 per cent, an increase of 3.1 per cent. Nevertheless, agricultural output showed signs of deceleration due to a steady decline in the international commodity prices of rubber, cocoa and especially palm oil which was the subject of a vigorous campaign in the United States to raise public awareness of the relationship between consumption of saturated fats and heart disease.

This means that the futures price will always be priced off the cheapest-to-deliver eligible cash market good. However, not all futures contracts are settled by the delivery of a cash market good; some are settled for cash. So far, we have discussed futures contracts in general terms and have referred to contracts being defined in terms of goods. It is certainly true that most futures contracts deal with commodities (e.g. aluminium, barley, cattle, citrus, cocoa, coffee, copper, corn, cotton, crude oil, gasoline, gold, heating oil, hogs, lead, lumber, nickel, oats, palladium, palm oil, plywood, pork bellies, potatoes, propane, rapeseed, rice, rubber, rye, silver, soybeans, sugar, tin, wheat, wool and zinc).

Automatically she looked around, too. And there, over the tops of the trees that grew on falling ground to their north, there on the other side of the valley was one of the liveliest country houses she had ever seen. As big as a cathedral it stood, in red Midland brick and warm Oxford limestone, with the noon sun full upon it. The woodland, marching up the hill, vanished before it but reached an arm around to the west, fringing the road, and then ran behind it to the north, forming a long backdrop to the palm house and the terraces. Only the clock tower on the stables showed from behind the trees. With the sun shimmering on the glass of the palm house and the frost turning every shadow pale blue, the whole place looked like a gem, set perfectly upon the hillside.

Towards A.D. 900 refugees coming north from Moslem-occupied Spain settled near Len and established in that area an architectural style part Christian and part Arabic, called Mozarabic. The buildings were based upon late Roman designs but also displayed Oriental features especially in decoration and their use of brickwork in constructional and ornamental forms. A very good example here is the Church of S. Miguel de la Escalada, built as part of a monastery in 91213. This basilica, overlooking the river Esla, is 70 feet long and has a five bay nave separated from the aisles by marble columns with mixed capitals Roman, Visigothic and tenth century Mozarabic (these last-named are palm leaf designs as in the Cordovan Mosque).
