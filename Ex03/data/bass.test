Another Collio white of real class is the 1990 Pinot Bianco from Vittorio and Giovanni Puiatti (91.16 from Winecellars 081 871 3979). The Pinot Bianco grape usually shows more character than the Pinot Grigio. In the hands of Puiatti, this Pinot Bianco is a stunning wine with a tight vinous concentration and considerable elegance and is a real rival to top-flight St Vran which costs much the same. Try it with grilled sea bass and fennel.

Once filled, the sides and riser were gently tapped with a hammer for a couple of minutes to expel trapped air, which can cause surface voids.

Like many young American composers he studied with Nadia Boulanger, but after 1925 set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found in Stein's writings. When he collaborated directly with her in opera the result was of historical significance. First came Four Saints in Three Acts, produced in 1934, and then The Mother of Us All (1947), which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage works of Philip Glass. In Four Saints Thomson's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then, when it stuck, wrote it down to a figured bass .

The ingredients were just right: three highly intelligent soloists (Lynne Dawson, Anthony Rolfe Johnson and David Wilson-Johnson); a small but alert choir (excellently trained by Julian Clarkson); a top-name period-instrument orchestra; and a conductor not afraid to cherish every aspect of Haydn's extraordinary score. This was music-making of a high order. Mackerras's account was compassionate but redblooded, direct but full of charm. It did not set out to be radically different, though Haydn's colourful scoring was certainly enhanced by the use of period instruments (including a fortepiano in the recitatives and a bass line reinforced more consistently by bass trombone and contra bassoon), but it succeeded in being unforced and unfettered.

Only instruments with rather a metallic sound recorded well: the solo banjo, the brass band, and percussion instruments such as bells and xylophones.

The Agnus is naturally the culminating variation; in Misericorde the four parts are expanded for it to six. Even when the highest part of a secular model was more obviously tuneful than that of Misericorde au martir amoureulx as we shall see, such songs were very fashionable in Paris at this time and the composer took few pains to disguise it (e.g. Gombert's Mass Je suys dshrite on a chanson attributed in the earliest source, Attaingnant's Trente chansons musicales (Paris, 1533) to Lupi, in later ones to Pierre Cadac), the incongruence evidently did not disconcert contemporaries. Clemens was not content to borrow Pierre Sandrin's very popular Doulce memoire (first published in the first book of Moderne's Le Parangon des chansons (Lyons, 1538)) for the Sicut erat of his first Magnificat Primi Toni; he based every section of his Magnificat Octavi Toni on a chanson, actually drawing attention to their titles in his superius part: The first five notes of Clemens's bass are indeed those of the plainsong eighth-tone Magnificat, but his superius is identical with that of Sermisy's C'est une dure despartie except that it does not follow Sermisy's repeat of the first two phrases and does repeat his last phrase.

Is it possible to observe formal principles with a mind preoccupied with spontaneous composition? It is certainly difficult to improvise well and keep to precise forms, because this means being able to remember and replay what we have played before. Nevertheless, it is important to achieve a semblance of coherent form.

Very high altitudes can also be attained by the employment of natural and artificial harmonics, but here again the use of these is the exception rather than the rule, and a good deal of practical knowledge of string technique is required for their safe and appropriate use. Those who wish to avail themselves of all the different kinds of harmonics possible will find the information they require in the larger text books of orchestration. We are more concerned here with what might be called the roast beef of scoring than with the confectionery. The normal layout of the string orchestra is in four-part harmony, the double bass either doubling the cellos or being silent. We would here stress the importance of giving plenty of rests to the double basses. Few things are more fatiguing to the ear than the incessant doubling of the bass at the octave below, in season and out of season. No organist in his senses would use sixteen-foot tone throughout an extended work, so why should the orchestrator? We would advise the beginner never to write his cello and bass parts on the same stave: if he does, he will almost surely fall into the error of over-using the double bass, his mind's ear, which acts through his eye, being almost certain to fail to register the lower octave. Moreover, we do not wish to give the impression that the cello and bass always work in double harness: on the contrary, they can be used independently to a quite large extent, though discretion and careful thought are very necessary in this matter, since the basses when used alone tend to sound rather dry, and if their part lies low and is far removed in pitch from the rest of the harmony it is too indeterminate in pitch to give satisfactory support unless it consists of a sustained or better (since the bow is short) a reiterated pedal note. In a quiet harmonic passage, however, in which the bass does not lie extremely low, the double basses may be entrusted with the lowest part. Always think how the passage would look if the bass were written at its true pitch instead of an octave higher.

Che, Rudi and Kylie And when the walls came tumbling down in Eastern Europe at the end of 1989 to reveal cowering and bitter populations, overflowing prisons and mental hospitals, ruthless armies of secret police and state informers, corrupt politicians and equality in misery only, they might have wondered how their parents could have given even a second thought to the self-evidently corrupt, ruthless and authoritarian appeal of the ideal of World Communism. Where their parents once had posters of Che Guevara, James Connolly, Rudi Dutschke and Rosa Luxemburg on their walls, Alice and Henry have Kylie Minogue, Madonna and Nelson Mandela at Wembley. There is a spirit of internationalism abroad again, it is true, but it has a solid bass line, a repetitive drum loop.

But her most extraordinary pictures of women are the visionary/allegorical decorations showing groups or tall, slender women arranged to create compositions of beautifully rhythmic contours.

Still, they were making an effort, putting on cheap food and jazz bands and so far the locals from the high rise flats across the road seemed to be accepting them.

As was always the case in the ballet de cour, the cast included both professional and aristocratic performers approximately 30 of each in 76 different roles. Louis XIV, who was 25 at the time, danced two roles a village maiden and a gypsy. If we were to mount a performance of this ballet, we would know, thanks to the livret, exactly how many dancers were needed and what roles they would play; the musical forces are, regrettably, another matter. Exx.1-3 show the three different textures that appear in the scores for this ballet: ex.1 solo voice and bass line (this is the opening vocal air of the ballet, the full text of which may be seen in illus.l); ex.2 an instrumental trio, with two treble instruments and bass (the ritournelle that follows the vocal air); ex.3 a five-part instrumental texture, each line notated in a different clef (the first entre).

I intend to consider the libretto as Britten's realistic reaction to a story that was all too easy to rended as either full-blown Grand Opera or stagey High Camp. Examples of the first sort were there to warn him before he began in Schiller's Mary stuart and Donizetti's relatively ineffective Maria Stuarda, plus dozens of other representations of Tudor history and the Virgin Queen in opera, novel and film. Britten includes Sir Walter Raleigh as a character in Gloriana. Raleigh, sung by a bass , is shown as dignified, even pompous, slightly resentful of the aspirations of younger courtiers such as Mountjoy and the Earl of Essex.
