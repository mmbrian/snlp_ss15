The evaluation data for this exercise consist of six sense-annotated English words with two way ambiguities: bass (fish/music), crane (bird/machine), motion (movement/legal), palm (tree/hand), plant (living/factory), tank (container/vehicle). A definition for each sense of an ambiguous word is provided in a separate file with the corresponding name.

The evaluation data [word].test files contains text snippets where the ambiguous word occurs, labeled with the correct sense:
#LABEL <correct sense>
Text Snippet

The format of the definitions files [word].definition is similar:
#DEFINITION <sense>
Text of definition

The definitions have been sorted according to their frequency of use in WordNet (in descending order).

The test data is taken from the freely-available TWA Sense Tagged Data corpus. The format has been simplified. For more information about the original data:
