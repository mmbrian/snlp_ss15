Along this fiery path and valley, the tossing waves by which the swell of the sea is restlessly divided, lift themselves in dark, indefinite, fantastic forms, each casting a faint and ghastly shadow behind it along the illumined foam Purple and blue, the lurid shadows of the hollow breakers are cast upon the mist of night, which gathers cold and low, advancing like the shadow of death upon the guilty ship as it labours amid the lightening of the sea, its thin mast written upon the sky, in lines of blood I believe, if I were reduced to rest Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose this. Its daring conception, ideal in the highest sense of the word, is based on the purest truth, and wrought out with the concentrated knowledge of a life, its colour is almost perfect, not one false or morbid hue in any part or line, and so modulated that every square inch of canvas is a perfect composition; its drawing is as accurate as fearless; the ship buoyant, bending, and full of motion ; its tones as true as they are wonderful; and the whole picture dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions the power, majesty and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable sea.

I had gone too far and experienced too much, I needed to slow down, to get back to the small things, the practical things, to measuring and cutting and fixing, and it was with relief that I noticed that daylight had begun to invade the room, I kept quite still, I held the glass firmly in my gaze, gradually the elements already worked on began to emerge, some more clearly than others, some in outline only and some only when they impeded the free flow of light through the glass, until the sun came up and was reflected back from the windows of the house opposite and I could sit and look at the glass and think back through the work and the mistakes and the few successes, and sense again with that sickening feeling in the pit of the stomach that the whole of the right hand side of the lower panel was still a mess, nothing there had been resolved, but then I drew back from that, though it kept trying to pull me back to itself, and concentrated on what was beginning to work, on the left hand areas both top and bottom and on the elegance of the frame and the joy of seeing the bare walls and the wainscoting appear through the empty areas, and as I moved round so different parts of the room appeared and the relation of the surface of the glass to what lay behind changed, precision and fluidity, precision and fluidity, he wrote, choice and chance, not choice alone and chance alone but the two together, that is why delay, not stoppage and not flow but delay, delay in glass, he wrote, as when the plane is late and you should have been gone, have already arrived perhaps, but you are still there, or the sprinter beats the gun and the whole field is called back, the race could have been over but it has not yet started.

Institutions have the pathetic megalomania of the computer whose whole vision of the world is its own programme. This extremely perceptive analysis of the institutional mind fits the police world like a glove, and recent elaborations in policing, along with its growth in the mainstream of the daily social process, supports Douglas's contention (ibid.) that an institution which is dependent upon authority can only demand more of the same. In such ontological circumstances this allegedly public service must be singularly unsuited to objective assessment of any external demands for a reduction in its power or to encompassing any critical analysis which might cause loss of prestige. Given this premise, we should not be surprised to find the police are in the forefront of support for proposals such as the introduction of identity cards; it was not surprising to find the 1988 Superintendents' Association conference not only supporting this motion , but arguing for the creation of twenty-four hour armed patrols throughout the country and making a plea for a national motorway squad.

So as the 1980s drew to a close, the sub-sectors dubbed Coal, Construction, Petroleum and Metals were all in fine shape, and their outlook for the 1990s is promising. Not that the eighties were without their problems: quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years, which affected all Railfreight's bulk traffics to some degree or other, there was the historic miners' strike of 19845, taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings. Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre-strike tonnages were exceeded, although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced. The merry-go-round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train remains in motion has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal's operations, and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative.

Ambition spoils French right aim of one big party From PATRICK MARNHAM in Paris MICHEL ROCARD'S Socialist government faces a vote of no confidence today which it is bound to win. The motion has been tabled by the Gaullist Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR), but neither the liberal Union pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF) nor the centrist Union Democratique du Centre (UDC) will support them. This further sign of disunity among the opposition comes just as the former president, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who is also the leader of the UDF, has called for a fusion of the seven parties of the centre-right into one big party of the centre-right by the beginning of 1992. Last week the first practical steps towards such a union were taken when leaders of the RPR, UDF and UDC met and agreed to form a tactical group to work out the most effective means of opposing the government. The first decision of this tactical group was not to table a motion of no confidence during the debate on the bill which sets this year's level of defence spending.

When I first encountered de Santillana's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive. Its attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message, for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science. They had argued that the new ideas about space and motion had arisen from an intellectual and, to a much lesser extent, empirical critique of the preceding, largely Anstotelian, notions.

Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, claims that the leak inquiry, which followed publication of parts of the report in a special edition of the Observer, discovered that copy 26 had been sent to the paper's owners, Lonrho. It is the first time the fraud squad has been directly accused of leaking the report. The MP's motion and three parliamentary questions directed at the Attorney-General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, allege the copy was given to the fraud squad to help its investigations into the successful 615million bid for Fraser by the Fayed brothers in 1985. Two fraud squad officers, Detective Inspector Graham Gooch and Detective Sergeant Ken Morgan, were sent out to Egypt as part of the investigation being conducted alongside an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. However, they were later taken off the case and transferred to other duties. Mr Campbell-Savours alleges that senior Scotland Yard officers then decided the team should not have any further contact with the Observer or Lonrho. But his motion adds: This House therefore questions why an officer chose to ignore that instruction by meeting the City editor of the Observer at least twice including on the eve of publication of the special edition. The motion goes on to say that it draws the natural and disturbing inference that the meetings and copy number 26 were linked.

It cannot be irrelevant to evangelism that so many unbelievers think the place we give to women in the Church is frankly absurd. He still feared polarisation and the creation of monochrome dioceses where clergy opposed to women priests would leave dioceses where they were ordained, and women ordinands and deacons would leave dioceses where they could not become priests. The legislation would have most impact on the dioceses, and Dr Runcie was anxious the debate should be extended to the grassroots. The motion was moved by the Rev Canon John Dale (Worcester) who said it was five years since the request for legislation on women priests was made. The measure as revised by the committee tried as hard as possible to accommodate the views of those who object to women priests. It creates space within the Church from which they can carry on their ministry for up to 20 years. Speaking against the motion, the Rev David Holloway (Newcastle) quoted a Canadian theologian. If it should turn out to be true that God did intend males to exhibit strength in leadership roles and females to excel more as the guardians of society's emotional resources, why should this be viewed ipso facto as an evil arrangement?

The First Plans for Rebuilding In 1822, Soane had prepared proposals for rebuilding Downing Street which omitted the Foreign Office and the houses opposite. Only the north side of the scheme was carried out in 18256 as the Privy Council Offices and the Board of Trade, and it was at the Treasury's instigation that Seward in 1833 produced a scheme to house various governmental offices in a block on the south side of the street, following Soane's lines. Plans to rebuild the Foreign Office appear to have been set in motion with the discovery of the poor state of the building and complaints from Palmerston that it was too small and had no rooms suitable for banquets and receptions.

As these sites are used up housebuilders have looked further afield to the small towns and villages of southern England which are now within commuting reach of London and the motorway-induced development radiating from it. Counties such as Berkshire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire have been faced with increasing government demands to provide more new housing and this has produced vociferous opposition from local residents who see their traditional communities under threat. Both high income commuters and lower income residents may resent development of this kind: the one because it interferes with their fantasy of the rural life, and the other because it pushes up house prices without providing any new job opportunities. Although some developers provide low cost or rented housing within their schemes, the majority of housing is aimed at the upper end of the market thus setting in motion a house price spiral which effectively freezes the locals out of home ownership.

The remedy granted by the High Court is an injunction, a discretionary remedy and a very serious one for the defendants, which may result in closure of the premises without compensation if that is the only way in which the nuisance can be abated. Courts are however reluctant to take any action which will close premises down, as evidenced by the Shoreham and Cheltenham cases, in which it was between four and five years after the issue of the original writ that the businesses were finally closed down. It is clear that time will be allowed for improvements to be carried out and only when it is clear that there is no prospect of the business in question being able to operate without causing an odour, which amounts to a statutory nuisance, will the court permit the issue of a writ of sequestration for contempt of court, in committing breaches of the undertaking not to cause a statutory nuisance, thus closing the business down without compensation. Michael Davis, J. who heard the motion by Shoreham-by-Sea Urban District Council, in the High Court, for an order that they be at liberty to issue writs of sequestration, held that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to satisfy the court that the defendants had acted wilfully in the sense of contumaciously, with a deliberate intention to defy the court order, since the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1965, do not contain in Order 45, Rule 5(1), the word wilful.

The source and drain are thus connected by a so-called inversion layer, in which the majority charge carrier (electrons) is the minority one in the bulk of the semiconductor (which is p-type, so holes are the majority carrier). Using a voltage to control the number of mobile electrons in this layer, or induced surface channel as it is sometimes called, is the basis of the device's operation. Interest in the scientific potential of the inversion layer was awakened in the late 1950s. Theoretical considerations indicated that if the electric field applied to the surface could be made strong enough to confine the mobile electrons to a very thin layer near the semiconductor's surface, with thickness comparable to the wavelength associated with the electrons there, then the electrons' motion perpendicular to the surface would be quantised.

The Davy lamp was the direct result of the mine owners' concern to recover coal, not from deeper shafts but from existing workings that were inaccessible because of a process known as creep. When the veins of coal were mined, pillars of coal had to be left to hold up the roof of the mine, rather like the pillars in a multistorey car park. The weight of the roof pushed the pillars down and the resulting pressure also forced the floor to buckle and move upwards. The downward motion of the pillars and the upward motion of the floor gradually combined to shut off the passageways and close the mine.

Temperatures in such systems reached about 10 electron volts (eV), about 100 000 K. Experiments had shown that the current-carrying ring of hot gas in a simple toroidal pinch was unstable, so that the hot gas (plasma) struck the walls and was cooled far too rapidly. Theoretical research in the United States confirmed that these instabilities were a natural characteristic of the system. This result was interpreted as having some favourable aspects. In particular, the resulting motion of the plasma column in the magnetic field motion that eventually destroyed the containment might heat the ions in the plasma; also, image currents in metallic conducting walls of the torus might limit the excusions of the plasma column.

It is tempting to assume that the same rule applies, but quasar redshifts are, in some cases, very much bigger than any measured galaxy redshift, so the assumption involves considerable extrapolation. It is this assumption, however, which is the basis of claims that the most distant quasars known are upwards of 10000 million light years away from us, receding at more than 90 per cent of the speed of light. A few astronomers have raised doubts about this extrapolation from ordinary galaxies to all extragalactic objects. They argue that redshifts can be produced in other ways than through the expansion of the Universe by gravity; by the rapid motion of an object, a true Doppler shift that, thanks to relativistic effects, produces a redshift even if the object is moving across the line of sight; or by other, unknown, means.

He never developed a proper Secretariat for the Nigerian government and confided in no one but his devoted brother, whom he appointed his Political Secretary. He was a passionate tourer, always in motion , descending on his Residents with floods of instructions which resumed their unceasing flow as soon as he returned to headquarters; and long before Northern Nigeria was brought under effective British occupation, he was composing his Political Memoranda , which in addition to his reflections on the subject of Indirect Rule contained instructions to his officers of a comprehensiveness simply beyond satire.

The sun, in brief, spins some 100 times slower than it should do if the equation is correct.

Sam had been using tape echo, or slap-back, and whether he was doing it on purpose or not, he also treated Elvis's voice like another instrument. The voice was real close to the rest of the music and most times back then, in country and pop, the vocal was always way out in front; even on RCA the voice was out more than we were used to. But in Heartbreak Hotel , which has a real deep echo, they had a speaker set up at one end of this long hallway and a microphone at the other end, and a sign on the door saying DON'T OPEN THE DOOR WHEN THE RED LIGHT IS ON. Room echo back then was virtually unheard of in recording, although they used it in motion pictures for sound effects.

Irrespective of the style of the piece, all music creates tension and release (dissonance and consonance) which brings on different emotions in its audience. In most pop music for instance, the verse sections of a song often end with a Dominant chord (ex D7, D11 etc.) which creates tension. This tension is then satisfyingly released by the resolution from the Dominant chord to the tonic chord which usually starts off the chorus of the song. Solos also create tension and release, depending on the soloist's ability to create motion over the chord changes via his/her improvising.

When people talk, air from the lungs is forced through the larynx into the mouth or nose to escape finally into the outside world. When sounds are said to be voiced, they are produced with vibration. This happens when there is a voluntary tightening of the vocal cords which sets vibration in motion as the air is on its journey from the lungs.

Plea to exempt elderly from VAT on fuel CLACTON is to be the launch-pad of an extensive campaign to save the poor or elderly from increases in fuel bills. Roy Smith, councillor for Golf Green, Clacton, will be urging Tendring District Council to support his motion and express its opposition to Government plans to raise prices. In the last Budget, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced the Government's decision to extend VAT to domestic gas and electricity at 8 per cent next year and at 17.5pc by 1995. Mr Smith's motion, which he will put before the council as soon as possible, says this will increase the weekly bills of all households, but will particularly affect pensioners and others on low incomes. The extra financial burden placed on those least able to afford such rises will inevitably impact on the services provided by this local authority, he said. Mr Smith hopes that his campaign will attract the support of all organisations for the elderly or those on low incomes. His motion is backed by Lionel Randall, last year's chairman of the council.

On this occasion the Director, against Cusick's advice, decided to do the shot by actually burying a full-size Dalek in a sand pit, the idea being to use a tow rope, attached to a Land Rover, to pull the machine from its sandy grave. The filming crew spent a full morning digging a suitably sized pit with a sloping ramp, filling it in again once the Dalek had been rolled into place. Only when the cameras were rolling was it heart-sinkingly apparent that the physics of inertia, represented by nearly a ton of resting sand, were greater than the physics of motion represented by the four skidding wheels of a Land Rover.

The bacteria have, embedded in their cell membranes, receptor molecules that is, proteins whose molecular architecture enables them to recognize the glucose molecules and tiny whip-like projections (flagella) which, by beating in unison, can row the bacteria up the glucose gradient. Mutants which lack the glucose receptors fail to show such behaviour, even though they will continue to make use of the glucose as an energy source if placed directly in contact with it. More complex single-celled animals, such as paramoecium, have similar projections, called cilia, connected at their bases by a system of fine threads, which enable the beat of the cilia to be coordinated. Except when it is actually feeding (it eats bacteria), the paramoecium is in constant motion , frequently bumping into obstacles in its path and, when it does so, reversing by switching the beat of the cilia on one side.

(3) The chairman of a licensing board has a second or casting vote when the voting in connection with a decision by the board is equal except where the matter being decided is the grant or provisional grant of a new licence. The proviso, which provides that the grant or provisional grant of a new licence shall be only by a majority vote is difficult to reconcile with s. 17, which provides that applications for new grants shall be refused if certain grounds are established. but otherwise shall be granted. It would appear the application must be granted, unless the motion for refusal on one of the grounds in 5.17 is passed by a majority vote. In Knowles v. Stirling District Council Licensing Board, 1980 S.L.T. (Sh.Ct.) 87, it was suggested that the vote on a motion to refuse a new grant, was a motion to determine whether one of the grounds for refusal had been established.

For instance, flying visually at the normal cruite; you set cruise power, hold your attitude for level flight and the aircraft will fly at the normal cruise. To vary the performance and change the airspeed, or climb and descend, you change your power and attitude in each case. The procedure is exactly the same when you fly on instruments; but without the external visual references. However, there is a greater possibility of the pilot becoming confused about the attitude or motion of the aircraft because of his own false sensations.

The party which commands a majority of seats in the House of Commons wins a general election. By convention, the monarch sends for the leader of the majority party in the Commons. The leader becomes the Prime Minister and forms a government by choosing the Cabinet from amongst party colleagues in the Commons and in the Lords. In theory, the Cabinet is still collectively responsible to the Commons, and so it is possible for a government to be defeated on a motion of no confidence in the Commons so that it would be forced resign, call for another general election, and face judgement at the polls.

Where proceedings are pending in the High Court, the court may order them to be transferred to a specified county court (r 7.11(1)). Where proceedings are pending in a county court, the county court or a judge of the High Court may order them to be transferred to the High Court or another county court provided that it is a court having bankruptcy jurisdiction (r 7.11(2)-(4)). 4 Transfer of proceedings A transfer may be ordered by the court of its own motion , on the application of the official receiver or on the application of an interested person (r 7.11(5)). A judge of one division of the High Court can order the transfer of any proceedings against the bankrupt from any other division of the High Court or the county court to his division of the High Court (r 7.15(2)). Part of a proceeding, such as a motion, may not be transferred from a county court to the High Court with the proceedings in general remaining in the county court (Re Kouyomdjian (1956) 2 All ER 286).

He went north in the summer and stayed there. Problems over the Anglo-Scottish border he could not avoid, but, that apart, his days in royal service seemed done. However, Richard II and his government were lurching towards an angry showdown with their critics. With the crisis already well in motion , the beleaguered king recalled his family's loyal servant to become treasurer of the realm on 17 January 1386.

Blackwell was an ensign in the City's horse militia as early as 1642 and a cornet in the parliamentary army by 1644; in 1645 he became a captain in Oliver Cromwell's own cavalry regiment, in which he served until June 1648. For most of the time he combined this with the very important post of deputy treasurer-at-wars. A political as well as a religious Independent, Blackwell's appointment may have been intended to reassure the army, since the war treasurers themselves were London aldermen of Presbyterian persuasion. In 1649 the Rump Parliament rejected a motion to make him a full treasurer, but in 1652 he became co-treasurer with an obscure backbench MP, and from 1653 with Richard Deane q.v.; they were also joint receivers-general of assessments, and thus responsible for the entire system of direct taxation and military expenditure.

Part of his home in Falkirk was converted into a scientific laboratory and workshop and he devoted his life to the pursuit of experimental science. His early training as an engineer stood him in good stead, and he not only devised but also constructed most of the apparatus that he used. Aitken's work covered a wide spectrum of physical science, and he had some ninety-eight contributions published in scientific literature. Significant papers on colour sensation appeared in 18712, being followed by work on oceanic circulation, glacier motion , and changes of state.

He signed the Engagement with the army in August 1647. In January 1648 he became a member of the committee of both kingdoms. A teller for the motion to make no further addresses to the king, Evelyn was later involved in plans to make a new peace approach to disengage the king from the Scots, and during the Newport negotiations he urged that extremist measures should be tempered while negotiations continued.

Initially he concentrated on Scotland, where the impact of railways had effectively opened the country for the first time to a large number of visitors. His combination of aesthetic judgement and technical virtuosity led to his celebrated views of the Loch of Park, 1859. These were the first photographs successfully to render sky and foreground in a single exposure. Capturing motion in a photograph was a goal for many photographers.

Ronald M Birse , Matthew (17531781), engineer and inventor, was born at 3 Narrow Wine Street, Bristol, where he was baptized 18 November 1753, the son of Mary and William Wasbrough, originally a barber-surgeon and peruke maker, who was in partnership with Roger Rice in a brass-founding and clock-making business in Narrow Wine Street. He had at least three older brothers. Taking an early interest in his father's work, he constructed a steam engine with which to drive all the lathes and other machines; in order to do this, he had to convert the reciprocating movement of the Newcomen-type beam engine into rotary motion . He achieved this by using a ratchet-and-pawl mechanism to produce the rotary motion, combined with a flywheel which reduced the otherwise excessive variations in the speed of rotation. On 10 March 1779 Wasbrough was granted a patent (no. 1,213) for a machine, which when applied to a steam-engine or any perpendicular motion will cause such movement to become circular, without the medium of a water-wheel, for grinding wheat and other grain, and for grinding, rolling, hammering, and other uses in mechanical operations. The ratchet-and-pawl device was quite effective in principle, but not robust or reliable enough in constant use, and it seems that, after he completed an engine to drive a mill owned by James Pickard at Snow Hill in Birmingham, it was found to be unsatisfactory, and a crank was substituted. It is not known who suggested this alteration, but anyhow the problem was solved; in the words of John Farey q.v.: The engine then answered so much better than anything which had been tried before that the same principle has been followed ever since. This was probably the first successful application of the crank to a steam engine in order to produce rotary motion. A patent (no. 1,263) was granted to Pickard on 23 August 1780 for a new-invented method of applying steam engines to the turning of wheeles, whereby a rotative motion is performed, and the power of the engine is more immediately and fully applied than by the intervention of water.

Alford made his name as a vigorous and informed opponent of impositions, monopolies, proclamations, and purveyance, and was an inveterate foe of Chancery. Already in 1610 he was one of a select number of the Lower House who met with the lord treasurer, Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury q.v., son of his father's patron, to discuss impositions. He was always reluctant to approve subsidies; in 1621, when other members were prepared to pledge their lives and fortunes to recover the Palatinate, he observed bitterly that the farmers would say, if you will have three taxes in one year, we must have three harvests in one year. Such rhetoric was backed by a proper concern for the freedom and order of the House, down to such details as a successful motion (16 December 1606) that the adjournment of a committee on a bill should be announced in the House.

Mercator (he was now using the Latin version of his name) left Copenhagen in 1654, stayed briefly in London, and then moved to Paris. He remained there for about two years before returning to England in July 1657 to take up a position as mathematics tutor to Joscelyne Percy, son of Algernon Percy, tenth Earl of Northumberland q.v., at Petworth, an appointment which seems to have been due to the influence of the Puritan reformer Samuel Hartlib q.v.. From 1658 until 1682 Mercator lived in London, teaching mathematics and engaging in vigorous debate with mathematicians such as William Oughtred, John Pell, and John Collins qq.v.. In 1666 Mercator made and presented to Charles II a marine chronometer that showed the inequality of the sun's motion from the apparent motion (John Aubrey, q.v.).

They had a daughter who died at the age of four in 1905 and two sons. Pollen became managing director of the Linotype Company in 1898, and proved himself to be both a shrewd businessman and an intelligent technical innovator. Pollen became interested in the problem of naval rangefinding after witnessing gunnery practice at sea in 1900. Following several years of development work and unsuccessful but nevertheless promising trials in late 1905 and early 1906, he won the support of John (later first Earl) Jellicoe, (Sir) Percy Scott, and Sir John (later first Baron) Fisher qq.v., which resulted in the establishment of an agreement to perfect the civilian inventor's ideas for a mechanical system of using observed ranges and bearings to calculate firing solutions for naval artillery that would take account of the relative motion of the firing ship and target.

Maximum ozone concentration occurs at a height of 1618 km in polar latitudes and at about 25 km over the equator. This ozone layer is important to society and the environment for two reasons. Firstly, the ozone absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation in the UV-B or 280320 nm wavelengths, thus warming the stratosphere and producing a steep temperature inversion between 15 and 50 km. As temperature decreases with height in the troposphere (reaching -40 to -80 C at the tropopause), the effect of a warm stratosphere is to act as a ceiling or lid to vertical motion in the troposphere that is, convective processes which produce clouds and precipitation are contained within the troposphere.

Such a method was proposed by Jussieu in 1789, and first in France and then elsewhere it was steadily adopted, and was improved as more characteristics were taken into account. But the difficulty about the natural method was that the classification had no shape. Cuvier seemed to contemporaries to have had little trouble in demolishing the evolutionary scheme of his contemporary Lamarck. Lamarck was eminent for his classification of invertebrates, and had in effect put the chain of being into motion , so that everything was moving slowly upwards, and creatures had not become extinct but had just changed, responding to their environment.
